# Smart-Wristband-Technology
S.H.I.E.L.D (Smart Healthcare IoT-based Emergency Life-saving Device) is a wearable smart wristband designed to provide early detection of medical emergencies and enable faster emergency response. The system continuously monitors vital parameters such as heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂) using optical sensing, along with motion tracking for fall detection. Unlike conventional fitness-oriented wearables, this solution is specifically focused on medical emergencies and life safety.

To address accuracy challenges associated with wrist-based sensing, the device incorporates an enhanced optical design with an additional light module for improved skin penetration and adaptive signal control. The embedded firmware applies noise filtering, buffer-based validation, and sensor fusion to reduce false alarms caused by panic, motion, or temporary physiological changes. A software-based calibration mechanism allows periodic calibration updates through a mobile application, ensuring long-term reliability by compensating for sensor aging, strap wear, and environmental variations.

When an abnormal condition or fall is confirmed, the wristband triggers a local alert and sends an emergency notification to a connected mobile application via Bluetooth. The application notifies caregivers first and includes a confirmation mechanism to prevent unnecessary ambulance dispatch. If no response is received within a defined time window, the system automatically escalates the emergency by sharing the patient’s GPS location with emergency services. A QR-based emergency feature enables nearby individuals to assist the patient during critical situations.

The proposed system offers a low-cost, scalable, and user-friendly solution for elderly individuals, chronic patients, and people living alone, significantly reducing response time during emergencies while maintaining safety and reliability.
